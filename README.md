## Overview

This repository contains the notebooks and input data used to extend the intermediate-asymptotics theory of sheared colloidal suspensions to finite particle concentrations using liquid-state integral equation theory.

The workflow combines:

- analytical intermediate-asymptotics solutions of the pair Smoluchowski equation with shear flow,
- construction of an effective potential of mean force,
- Ornstein–Zernike integral equation,
- Percus–Yevick (PY),
- Hypernetted Chain (HNC),
- Modified Hypernetted Chain (MHNC)

to compute

- pair correlation functions \(g(r)\),
- static structure factors \(S(k)\)

of colloidal suspensions under shear flow.

## Representative result

Structure factor of sheared hard-sphere colloidal suspensions predicted by the integral-equation theory. Increasing Péclet number enhances long-wavelength density fluctuations and modifies the main structural peak.
